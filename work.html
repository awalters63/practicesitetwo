	<h2>Overview of Work Experience</h2>
		<p>Currently I have four jobs, all of which I balance with school. They are all part-time, which is how I'm able to give them the focus they need. Here is my <a href="ashley.resume.pdf" download>resume</a>.</p>

		<h3>The Institute of Biohealth Innovation (GMU)</h3>
			<p>I work at the Institute of Biohealth Innovation (GMU) as a <b>Junior Science Writer</b>. I started in February 2024 and my job is to write articles for publication to promote the activities, events, and accomplishments of the Institute. In order to do so, I interview key organizers and researchers to gather background information and sufficient understanding of the subject material. I also do whatever I can to contribute to the main goal of the Institute:advancing human health and well-being at multiple scales.</p>

		<h3>Chick-fil-A</h3>
			<p>I work at Chick-fil-A as a <b>Team Lead</b> and <b>Trainer</b>. I started in August 2020 and my job is to lead shifts, balance money, and efficiently manage team members and guests to ensure a productive experience. I was promoted after showing exemplarieness in both the team member position and trainer position. I have experience in training team members in all positions of the restaurant's front-of-house and I interact with customers directly to ensure an accurate and positive fast-food experience.</p>
